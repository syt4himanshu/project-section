                <p>
                    UBA students embarked on a transformative project aimed at revolutionizing transportation in rural India. Their endeavor, titled "Design and Development of Low-Cost Converted E-Bicycle for Panjari Lodhi Village," represents a fusion of innovative engineering and sustainable development principles. The project's focal point lies in Panjari Lodhi Village, nestled amidst the rustic landscape of rural India, where transportation woes have long plagued the local populace. Recognizing the need for an affordable and eco-friendly mobility solution, the UBA students, armed with their ingenuity and determination, set out to make a difference. At the heart of their initiative is the conversion of old, conventional bicycles into hybrid electric bicycles. This ingenious approach not only breathes new life into discarded cycles but also presents a cost-effective alternative to traditional electric bicycles. By repurposing existing resources, the project aims to achieve a remarkable 40-50% reduction in transportation costs for the residents of Panjari Lodhi Village, thereby fostering economic empowerment and accessibility.

                    We are proud to announce that 2021 passout Alumni's of E&tc Department Mr.Atharva Hampiholi and Mr.Ashutosh Maske along with the help of Students of E&TC Department 2nd Year 1)Yogendra Topre, 2)Mehandi Bhoyar, 3)Prajwal Atkale, 4)Prathamesh Lakhe, 5)Rohit Thakre, 6)Sahil Padole, 7)Sakshi Bhoyar, 8)Shruti Kayarkar, 9)Shubhangi Kaikadi and 10)Tajshree Zade from St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology, Nagpur have successfully Installed a 'Smart Solar Street Lamp' at the village 'Khatmari' under the 'Unnat Bharat Abhiyan' which is a flagship program of the Government of India for development of Rural Regions.

                    This Solar Lamp is equipped with multiple Proprietary Smart features such as Automatic Solar Panel Cleaning System, Automatic Battery Cutoff under low voltage, Automatic Night Light, Anti-Theft Alarm etc. Due to the accumulation of dust over the surface of the solar panels, the efficiency of the panel drops down as much as 30% resulting into a very low operation time of the lamp and under worst case scenario the lamp may stop working totally. 

                    The Automatic cleaning system makes sure that the Solar Lamp can continue to operate even without any maintenance. This further increases energy efficiency by 15 to 25%. All other smart features make sure that the batteries do not get over-discharged, thereby increasing their lifespan and requiring no human intervention to turn on or off the lamp.

                <h2>UBA Collaborative Project</h2>
                <p>In response to the challenges faced by farmers in Vidarbha, such as unpredictable rainfall and water scarcity, our team is developing an innovative solution under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan 2.0. We are designing and implementing an automated farming system for Khatmari Village, leveraging the power of drone technology and machine learning. This project aims to improve crop yields, reduce reliance on manual labor, and enhance the overall economic well-being of the farming community. By utilizing a DJI Pro drone equipped with a high-resolution camera, we will collect data on various factors like soil moisture and crop health. This data will be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and other agricultural practices. Our solution will not only increase efficiency but also minimize risks associated with traditional farming methods, ultimately empowering farmers and contributing to the sustainable development of the region</p>
